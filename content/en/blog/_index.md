title: "Blog"

This is the list of blog posts.

To customise the thumbnail that appears on social platforms, add a `cover` block to each
blog post front matter. The same value is used as the hero image on the page and for the
Open Graph/Twitter card preview. For example:

```
cover:
  image: /img/sample-cover.png
  alt: "Optional description for screen readers"
```

You can also define a default cover for all blog entries by adding the same block under
`cascade` in this file when needed.
